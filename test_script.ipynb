The input image  \\nundergoes multiple layers of convolutions and pooling in the  \\nencoding  path,  with recurrent  residual  blocks  enhancing  \\nfeature  extraction  at each stage.

RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION  \\nThe data set that is used in this paper  is obtained  from  [14] \\nwhich  consists  of Landsat  8 images  and corresponding  ground  \\ntruth.
